# CinemaApp
A basic full-stack monolith App developed in Java using Spring MVC. Movie ticketing app. Familiarizing with thymeleaf, WebSockets and Spring Security. 
Backend developed in java with Spring, frontend with HTML and a bit of CSS and Javascript (Learning my way around the frontend technologies).
Wanted to also implement the payment part for the tickets, but I will add this functionality later.
